## Example

![demo-screenshot](./doc/img/demo-screen.png)

This is screenshot of the form, generated with bootstrap renderers. Metadata for this form is [here](./packages/demo/src/meta/complete.json).


## Features

- easy to generate entire form from the simple metadata description;
- set up custom layout in JSX (not in metadata, because markup-on-json is pain);
- easy to add custom types of fields (renderers);
- easy to add custom layouts;
- pure! (no state, just props). Easy to integrate with frameworks (Redux, etc);
- nested forms (in progress). Easy to implement dynamic forms (add/remove fields at runtime, etc).

## TODO

- complete this README.md
